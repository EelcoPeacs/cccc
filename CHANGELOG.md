* Modifications to support use of (free) MS Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 in place of MS Visual Studio 5/6. For some reason, the use of friend functions IncrementNesting and DecrementNesting has stopped working (possibly because these functions are only seen as inline definitions within the CCCC_Token class body).  These have been converted to static member functions of CCCC_Token and all is now well. [tim_littlefair]
